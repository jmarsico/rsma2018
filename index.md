## Course Description

> Thermostats, locks, power sockets, and lights are all being imbued with ‘smarts’ making them increasingly aware and responsive to their environment and users. This course will chart the emergence of the now ‘connected world’ to explore the possibilities for future products and connected spaces with the Internet of Things. This introductory, hands-on course invites students to creating connected products without any knowledge of programming, electronics or systems. Students will be introduced to interactive connected technologies through a series of hands on exercises, collaborative projects, in-depth discussions, and instructor led tutorials. Topics explored will include awareness, real-time sensing and communication, embedded intelligence, and designing experiences for the internet of things.  By the end of this course, students will be familiar with the core skills, the considerations involved and design process required to build a connected system. Students will also apply this learning in collaborative groups to realize a prototype connected device.

## Logistics

1. All students taking the course must complete the [online skills survey](https://goo.gl/forms/e0dQKTzOA5buzAGr2)

3. Our [Slack community]({{ site.slack }}) is the main hub for course updates, discussion and content. Read more about the [slack and its role in the course](/tech/collaboration/2015/11/13/using-slack/).  Use slack communications with the instructors and TA's too (i.e. don't email us!). __Highly recommended__: [Download](https://slack.com/downloads) the Slack client for your smartphone or desktop and _enable notifications_!

2. Creative projects should be documented on the [Gallery]({{site.gallery}}). This site contains [a guide]({{site.base_url}}/tech/formats/update/2015/11/11/the-gallery/) to using the gallery. These are due _before_ Thursday's class.

2. [Weekly readings]({{site.base_url}}/readings) should be completed by Friday evening. Summaries should be completed on canvas.

2. It's your responsibility to be familiar with the [course policies and standards]({{site.baseurl}}/2017/01/01/full-syllabus/) found in the full syllabus. If you cannot attend classes make sure you know what to do. 	

2. There is a [course fee]({{site.base_url}}/course/structure/2016/01/07/resource-fee/) and this gives you an IoT development kit. This should cover most of your needs for projects. But at times you'll need special software, hardware or tools to complete your projects. Many of these will be made as part of this course. If there's something else you need let us know.

2. No late work accepted. Please don't ask.
