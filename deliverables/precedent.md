	tl;dr; Students will be asked to share a series of discoveries (code samples, articles, libraries, etc) that will benefit the group. Students will prepare at least 5 discoveries over the course of the semester.
</p>


## Documenting Discoveries

Throughout the course, you are encouraged to go beyond the course materials and uncover new ideas and techniques related to the internet of things. To incentivize this self-directed exploration, it is a graded component of this course. 

To receive this grade you are to regularly research and report technical solutions, approaches and examples that are relevant to the course or a project that's been assigned. 

The example should be one of the following (unless otherwise instructed): 

- an example project, speculative proposal or commerical product that is exciting, innovative or inspirational;
- a library or extension that could be used in a project for the course;
- a technical tutorial that provides guidance on implementing some aspect of IoT/physical computing solutions;
- articles or best practice that provides guidance on designing / prototyping IoT outcomes; 
- a research paper or underlying technology that relates to the course topics;
- code samples that illustrate a solution, workflow or technical strategy.

Simply put, __find and report resources that will help you make better projects as part of this course.__

### Learning Objectives

As part of the exercise, students will:

- build familiarity with projects and approaches that are relevant to the course;
- identify and critically review technical solutions that relate to the course;
- help co-create a set of exemplars to draw on as part of their own creative projects;
- increase their ability to describe and implement technical solutions for lightweight IoT projects.

### Deliverables: 

Add your documented example to the [#discoveries]({{site.slack}}/archives/discoveries) as a new post on slack (see below). The discovery should include a link to the resource, it's creators, and a short narrative (100-200 words explaining why someone else should pay attention to it)

### Submitting your work: 

You'll submit your precedents on Slack. Each discovery should be _submitted separately._

To submit your work: 

- Open Slack and navigate to the [#discoveries]({{site.slack}}/archives/discoveries) channel
- In the text box (bottom), click the ```+``` on the left hand side. Choose the option to 'Create a new post'
- In the post editor, the title should match the name of the project 
- Add some text about your discovery. This should start with: a) link(s) to the project website b) a list of original creators/artists, c) relevant images or embed videos (see below).
- When you have added your post, click the ```Share``` button on the top right. 

### Template and documentation

In each post,  embed a video and/or images of the project, and write a short critical reflection on the project (about 100-200 words) in which you cover the following:

1. _Overview:_ Briefly describe the project (a couple of sentences) and who made it.
2. _Discovery:_ Describe why did you select it, what did you learn, why is it interesting to you? 
4. _Relevance:_ Describe why you believe _someone should pay attention to it_
7. _Application:_ Finally, give some examples of how you might use it in your project or what it might be used to do.

__Remember:__ Create a separate post for each example. 

### Grading

You receive 2% for each discovery, for a maximum of 10% credit. You are expected to share 5 discoveries over the course of the semester. Discoveries will be graded as __pass/fail__:

- _0 - Unsatisfactory_ - Incomplete or failing work. The example does not fit within the constraints of the project, is not relevant to the course or does not demonstrate any comprehension, reflection or analysis on it. 

- _1 - Satisfactory or better_ - Meets or exceeds the minimum requirements for the exercise; Highlights a good example within the scope of the exercise AND shows adequate research and reflection. 

This will be applied to EACH discovery. 

To guarantee you pass the assignment, make sure you have: 

- Used the correct format and channel for your post on Slack <sup>*</sup>
- Added each discovery as a separate post on Slack <sup>*</sup>
- Appropriately titled and given credit to the creators of the project/work <sup>*</sup>
- Have included at least one link to the resource <sup>*</sup>
- Written between 100-150 words on the discovery and it's relevance (not copy-paste descriptions!) <sup>*</sup>
- Made an effort to reflect on the discovery and it's relevance/utility
- Written clearly, effectively and critically

_<sup>*</sup> Incidates that if you do not meet these criteria you will immediately fail the assignment._

More information can be found in the [Grading, Feedback and Policies]({{site.baseurl}}/2016/08/22/grading#discoveries) section

### Constraints

- No two students may submit the same work. Claim early. 
- Avoid examples already in the [Resources section]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/) of the course site or that are covered in class. 

### Starting points

To help guide your explorations, a list of potential places will be provided in the [Product Hunt discovery brief]({{site.baseurl}}/assignments/product-hunt/) and in the [Resources section]({{site.baseurl}}/resources) of this site. 

_Note_: This is by no means an exhaustive list. You should explore beyond these!
