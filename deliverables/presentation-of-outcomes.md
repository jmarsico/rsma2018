## Final Presentation and Demonstration

For the final showcase, each group will have an opportunity to present and demonstrate their final project. 

Each group will: 

- present their design scenario and prototypes in a 5-minute final presentation 
- Provide a live-demonstration of a working prototype for a connected experience.

Invited guests will provide feedback and discussion on your work. 

### Learning Objective 

As part of the exercise, students will:

- learn to communicate their ideas for IoT and connected experiences; 
- illlustrate how integratating considerations across business, design and engineering helps to prepare meaningful connected products
- gain hands on experience in demonstrating connected experiences with hands-on technical prototypes; and 
- participate in a discussion with experts to get feedback and insight on their projects;

### Deliverables: 

- A working prototype that includes software (code), hardware and electronics elements. 
- A slidedeck and presentation of the conceptual design
- An in class demo. of the completed project.

#### Some Tips for your Demo 

As part of this review session, you'll walk invited guest through and demonstrate your prototype. During the demo, avoid slides and videos. Focus on clearly explaining the idea by showing how it works. 

For a successful demonstration you carefully plan the demo so that it tell's a story (rather than showing features). Carefully plan and rehearse how you step through the features and functionality. Make sure you know the breaking points and can avoid them. _Donâ€™t forget to provide opportunities or invitations for guests to try for themselves!_

Some cautionary notes:
An end of semester showcase is often a pressure filled experience. You're working with code and prototyping interactive systems for the first time.

- When you get it to work enough to demo, stop! Avoid the temptation the morning of the demo to add one more thing. Last minute tweaks will likely mean last minute breaking points. Similarly, don't edit your code 5 minutes before the showcase!
- Things can and will go wrong. It'll be a busy space with lots of cross talk. Plan for this event. Have a canned demo on video on hand that you can switch to if everything goes down the drain.
- If you plan to have other people try your prototype, make sure you've tried it with other people. Spending 10 minutes having another person try it will quickly show you where it can and might go wrong on the day.



### Grading

Grading is per creative projects.

> __A note on feedback:__ Discussion with the invited guests should be incorporated into your final documentation. Appropriate revision should be made to account for their suggestions and feedback (where appropriate.)
