#### Particle Platform

* [Particle.io ](http://particle.io)

* [Platform documentation](https://docs.particle.io/guide/getting-started/intro/photon/)  - guides to the photon 

* [Community](https://community.particle.io) - discussion board with code samples, tutorials and projects

* [Hackster Channel](https://particle.hackster.io) - well documented examples of projects created using particle

#### Programming, Debugging and Testing

* There are two main ways to develop your code for Particle Projects. You can either use [Particle Build](http://build.particle.io) (an online IDE) and write your code in the browser or you can use Particle Dev (a desktop IDE available for Windows, Linux and OSX ) to write code on your computer. Particle Dev is recommended. 

* For more advanced users, the [Particle Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://www.particle.io/products/development-tools/particle-command-line-interface) is extremely useful for code development, firmware deployment, device management and more. See also the [CLI Docs](https://docs.particle.io/reference/cli/)

* [Particle Console](http://console.particle.io) - an invaluable tool for seeing the status of your devices, calling functions, checking variables, monitoring events and more.

##### Using the Particle Framework

In this course we use the Particle Photon, but there are a range of other devices that can allow you to build connected products and projects. 

* [Particle Electron](https://www.particle.io/products/hardware/electron-cellular-dev-kit) - supports the dev of IoT applications over cellular communications (2G, 3G)

* The [Bluz](https://bluz.io) and [RedBear Duo](https://redbear.cc/product/wifi-ble/redbear-duo.html) both use the Particle framework but support BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) communciations

* [Raspberry Pi's](http://www.raspberrypi.org) also play nice with the Particle framework but allow you to program more advanced computation (e.g. camera based applications, audio recording/sensing, interaction with USB periperhals, interaction with screens, etc.)
