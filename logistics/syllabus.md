## Course Description

> How can embedded computation change the way we experience our surroundings? What is the value of creating dynamic spaces? This class will focus on the design and prototyping of reactive spaces. Over the course of several small projects and one large final project, students will learn where, when and how to embed computationally-driven experiences into the built environment. Students will be required to design, render and build experiences and interactions for specific locations and with specific intentions. By the end of the course students should expect to know how to use sensor and API data to manipulate an environment through light, sound and motion output. Previous experience with programming, electronics or fabrication is encouraged, but not required. However, students are expected to learn these skills on their own with minimal in-class instruction.


## Learning Objectives

#### _1. Domain Knowledge_
- Develop a working vocabulary related to media architecture; being able to articulate your opinions on this niche field.
- Be able to describe the value of embedding dynamic works into the built environment.


#### _2. Technical Skills_
- Develop a general knowledge of data acquisition and data flow.
- Learn to work with basic physical computing hardware, including microcontrollers and basic sensors
- Control commercial lighting fixtures using live data
- Create custom software/hardware solutions for site specific works

#### _3. Collaborative Prototyping_
- Collaborate with students from different disciplines; leveraging unique domain knowledge to create more comprehensive prototypes.
- Learn from students of different disciplines, pulling their knowledge into your personal practice.
- Develop quick, to-the-point prototypes of large-scale installations. 

## Prerequisites

The course does not have any prerequisites. Although a basic understanding of physical computing, rapid physical prototyping and/or programming will be useful in group projects.

## Instructional Methods

Students will learn through the design and completion of multiple themed projects. Classes will also include readings, discussions of precedent research, technical workshops and group critiques.

## Small Projects

The course revolves around
