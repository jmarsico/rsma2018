<h2 id="learning-objectives">Learning Objectives</h2>

<p>As part of this assignment you’ll be asked to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Explore the ambient, glancable and peripheral interfaces by developing a conceptual design based on the principles</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Develop your working knowledge of actuators (motors, light, sound) in feedback scenarios.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Work collaboratively to develop a conceptual design and translate that into a working prototype with the Particle platform;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Explore design for IoT through hands on exploration and by developing a prototype connected solution.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="context--problem-space">Context / Problem Space</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ambient objects aim to make data glanceable. They connect us to complex information like weather and traffic in an extremely accessible format. They don’t intrude like our phones which buzz and whirr to demand attention, instead they subtly nudge us to act when we happen to glance in their direction. They are calm and they distill information from the broader world into the minimum we need to know in order to act.</p>

<p>IDEO devised three concepts for making Mondays more joyful:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The result is MonYay!, a collection of objects and digital concepts designed to bring more laughter, play, and serendipity to otherwise manic Mondays. Lolzzz is an alarm clock that starts the week with a giggle.  A gratefulness ritual, Sincerely, helps smooth the transition from weekend to work week. And PopUp and Notifly is a bubbly digital calendar and desktop notification system designed to draw attention to hidden opportunities for joy.“ See <a href="https://bringjoy.ideo.com/">https://bringjoy.ideo.com/</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or putting it another way. You’re going to design for periphery, by considering charm and emotional engagement. Can we use evocations of fear, joy or anger as resources to create affective <em>and</em> effective ambient information?</p>

<h2 id="brief">Brief</h2>

<p>Using this precedent as inspiration:</p>

<p><strong>Design an ambient device that evokes an ‘emotional gesture’. Prepare a conceptual design and realize a working prototype of an ambient object that presents online data in a physical space and is designed using on an emotional reference.</strong></p>

<p>You should design an device that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>embodies specific information in an ambient way (e.g. weather, traffic, calendar, transporation, environmental, situational, etc.)</li>
  <li>it is designed to operate in a specific context (on a desk, on a shelf, in the kitchen, on the wall, etc.)</li>
  <li>can <em>notify</em> an end user of relevant information (e.g. it changes state and this change is recognizable and relevant)</li>
  <li>and is evocative of an emotional gesture (e.g. joyfulness, curiousity, sadness, fear) and that evocation is well paired with the information and context.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="suggested-process">Suggested Process</h2>

<p>Draw on the design process from IDEO as you develop your device:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Emotion:</em> Start by exploring the <a href="http://atlasofemotions.org/">Atlas of Emotions</a> a great resource to understand the five universal emotions.</li>
  <li><em>Inspiration</em>: Identify an emotional ‘gesture’ (e.g. a dog’s wagging tail, laughter, a tickle, a squeel). Create a mood board around this gesture and analyze the aesthetic qualities (movement, color, mood, etc.);</li>
  <li><em>Design</em>: Develop a conceptual design for an emotional interface, including what data/information/interactions it would be coupled to; Abstract it, reinterpret it and encode it in an object. Design a way to evoke it using one form of actuation (light, sound, motion, vibration)</li>
  <li><em>Prototype</em>: Give the device form by making a (to-scale) physical representation and working interactive prototype</li>
  <li><em>Interaction</em>: Document the prototype’s “use in context” to illustrate your design.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="project-requirements">Project Requirements</h2>

<p>Your project is to create a device that supports ambient information awareness.  In addition it must meet these requirements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The device must connect to a remote (online) information source and make use of that data to create value for a user.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The device must represent that data in physical space using sound, light, movement or other formats.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A user should be able to clearly recognize changes in information or information which requires their action. <em>In other words:</em> you should design a clear mapping from the digital information to information presentation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The final outcome should be close to a product, it should be integrated into some designed physical form (casing, object, etc.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You should “live” with the object for a few hours and evaluate its usefulness and recommend iterations. Use this to document the transition in states (e.g. with a timelapse.)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Hint:</strong> IFTTT makes it easy to connect to lots of online content and is really useful for ambient explorations. There’s lots of tutorials, guides, code samples and ways to access / use this data.</p>

<p>You are not required to create a fully implemented product prototype, but should have a working demonstration.</p>

<p><em>Note</em> Light is low hanging fruit. You’re strongly encouraged to push beyond this and show creative applications of haptic, vibrotactile, movement and sound in designing your ambient outcome.</p>

<h2 id="planning-your-project-ie-discovery">Planning your project (i.e. <a href="/deliverables/discoveries">discovery</a>)</h2>

<p>Due: <strong>Thursday, 2nd Feb 2017; directly before class.</strong></p>

<p>The first phase of your project is planning. This is a quick assignment designed to help you gather some inspirational resources and assets you’ll need to complete it.</p>

<p><em>Precedent Discovery</em>: Each person in the group should research and report on <strong>one ambient device</strong>. Try to explore exciting, new or compelling way to interact with data through objects or spaces. <em>Create a Post</em> in the <a href="http://rsma2018.slack.com/messages/discoveries/">#discoveries</a> channel on slack that includes the label “#ambientdevice” for grading purposes e.g. AirReal by Disney Research #ambientdevice. For more details, see <a href="/deliverables/discoveries">discoveries</a>.</p>

<p><em>Constraints:</em> No two students may submit the same work. Claim early.</p>

<p><strong>Links and Resources</strong></p>

<p>To start your search, look at the following aggregators, feeds, and forums:</p>

<ul>
  <li>International Conference on Tangible, Embedded and Embodied Interactions, e.g. <a href="http://tei.acm.org/2016/">TEI 2016</a></li>
  <li>ACM’s Annual Computer Human Interaction Conference (CHI) has a host of tangibles presented. See last year’s program for example. <a href="http://chi2016.acm.org/wp/">http://chi2016.acm.org/</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.creativeapplications.net/">Creative Applications</a> - aggregator of arts creative practice that regularly features physical, embedded, tangible computing and interactive/reactive spaces.</li>
  <li><a href="http://userwww.sfsu.edu/infoarts/links/wilson.artlinks2.html">Steve Wilson’s (not maintained) site</a> contains multitudes of tangible and reactive projects</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.disneyresearch.com">Disney Research</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://code.arc.cmu.edu/">CMU’s CodeLab</a></li>
  <li>MIT’s <a href="http://tangible.media.mit.edu/">Tangible Media</a> Group</li>
  <li>Northwestern’s <a href="http://tidal.northwestern.edu/">TIDAL Lab</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Note: This is by no means an exhaustive list, there’s many more in the <a href="/resources">Resources</a> section too. You should explore beyond these!</p>

<h2 id="deliverables">Deliverables:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Conceptual Design: Provide a high level design overview that considers and describes: what context it operates in (is it a personal device, site specific, etc.); what it does and how it behaves; how someone would or could interact with it; and how these interactions unfold to lead to the desired outcome? Detail your design proposal with a series of illustrations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prototype: Deliver a functional mock up of the ambient device prototyped using Particle.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Storyboard: Create a <a href="https://www.fastcodesign.com/1672917/the-8-steps-to-creating-a-great-storyboard">storyboard</a> showing the proposed interaction and <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/DebAoki/introduction-to-storyboarding-for-user-experience-design">workflow</a> with the device.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Video: Create a short (1-2 minute) video illustrating how the device would be used. This should illustrate the intended scenarios, interactions, etc.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Outcomes should be reasonably well developed and documentation should be submitted to the Gallery on or before the deadline.</p>

<h2 id="final-documentation">Final Documentation:</h2>

<p>Projects should be added to the Gallery. You should provide <strong><em>a clear and concise</em></strong> description of your project, your process, and the outcomes. It should be quick to get an overview of the project.  Ideally, your description of the outcomes should be repeatable too i.e. anyone in the class can replicate it easily from the information provided.</p>

<p>Your project documentation should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Clearly explain and provide a succinct overview of the problem and how the proposed product solves that problem</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Briefly describe the design process (iterations, refinements, challenges encountered)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Document the outcome itself (code, circuit diagrams, photos, design files, 3d models, video demonstrations, etc. as required) and provide a short narrative. A bill of materials (sensors, input devices, actuators, and other components) should be provided. This documentation should be sufficiently rich to allow anyone to repeat / recreate it.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="using-online-material">Using Online Material:</h2>

<p>It is perfectly fine to use examples, code, tutorials, and things you find on the web to help you realize your project. That’s part of the open-source mentality that surrounds much of Making, Arduino and microcontrollers. However, you cannot just copy and paste these solutions. In your documentation <strong><em>you must acknowledge where you got this content from</em></strong>. Include a link to any tutorials, guides, or code that are part of your final solution.</p>
