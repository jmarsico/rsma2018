<h2 id="learning-objectives">Learning Objectives</h2>

<p>As part of this assignment you’ll be asked to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Explore opportunities for enriching human relationships and creating attachment through products</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Develop your working knowledge of co-ordinating communications and network-interactions between devices</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Work collaboratively to explore and develop a well realized conceptual design and working prototype for a paired device.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>

<p>For years, technology has empowered new forms of human-to-human connections. Mobile phones and SMS are an incredible example of this - they have radically transformed when, where and how we can reach out to other people.</p>

<p>While the Internet of Things is often talked about in terms of sensors, hardware and functional utility, it also creates new opportunities to enrich human experience; to not just connect objects, devices and things to one another but to help us better connect with the people in our lives.</p>

<p>Connected objects have much potential to create more intimate understanding between two or more geographically separated people. They can allow us to understand and empathize with one another by giving us a window into some facet of another person’s daily experience or by allowing us to share a facet of our day.</p>

<h1 id="examples-of-remote-communication-and-connected-intimacy">Examples of Remote Communication and Connected Intimacy</h1>

<p>There are already many examples of ways that connected objects can do this.</p>

<p>Many projects explore simple ‘gestures’ that can be transmitted through connected objects. How can a handshake, a pat on the back or a hug be sent between two people across  distances?</p>

<p>The <em><a href="http://tangible.media.mit.edu/">Tangible Media Group</a></em> at MIT created <a href="http://tangible.media.mit.edu/project/intouch/">inTouch</a> in 1998. It is designed to explore “new forms of interpersonal communication through touch”. It allows a gesture to be sent from one  allowing two sets of connected rollers. Rolling the cylinders on one devices creates the corresponding action on the paired device, and vice versa, allowing two people to share</p>

<p>They continued this line of exploration with <a href="http://tangible.media.mit.edu/project/lumitouch/">LumiTouch</a> in 2001 where they developed a series of paired picture frames. Touches on the frames are sensed and when it is held the other frame lights up as an indication that the other person is thinking about them. It allows for a moment of intimacy to be shared and for new interpersonal communications with subtle gestures.</p>

<h2 id="brief">Brief</h2>

<p><strong>Prepare a conceptual design and realize a working prototype of a product for connected intimacy.</strong></p>

<p>You are asked to imagine a device that will be shared between two people (a couple, etc.) allowing them to communicate over  distances.</p>

<h2 id="project-requirements">Project Requirements</h2>

<p>Your project is to create two connected devices for simple interpersonal communication.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The devices should be <strong>identical</strong> (i.e. create two of the same device)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each device should be capable of <strong><em>sending__ and __receiving</em></strong> a ‘<em>gesture</em>’ to/from the other</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The devices should work <strong>across distances</strong> (not require two people to be together to operate)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You should identify a simple communication problem and design for that context.</p>

<p>You are not required to create a fully implemented product prototype, but should have a working demonstration.</p>

<h2 id="food-for-thought">Food for thought:</h2>

<p>Remote intimacy often considers sending ‘gestures’ that help couples coordinate and communicate over a distance. They normally think about adding missing cues to enhance a relationship. Have we considered the fully messyness of social relationships? Take cues from this weeks readings and consider the complex socio-cultural implications of maintaining relationships over distances. Here’s some examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Objects already play a role in relationship management. Giving gifts. Photos of important moments. Smashing plates or slamming doors in a heated moment. A potted plant as a proxy for a child. What are the everyday actions with objects that might not exist or could be amplified to work over distances? Why are they important
    <ul>
      <li><em>sidenote</em>: it’s perfectly OK to design a tool for a specific couple. It doesn’t have to be a generalizable thing. In fact personalizing it might make it much richer and give it a compelling context.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Technology is already embedded and intertwined with relationships. Think about the technologies that effect relationships when people are together and explore what they could be in the context of distance relationships? See: <a href="http://howdoidate.com/relationships/relationship-issues/resolve-relationship-conflict-with-these-gadgets/">Use technology to avoid relationship conflict</a></li>
  <li>Could you design for conflict not just connection? It’s not just about enriching and maintaining a relationship. <em>“There is no such thing as a relationship without conflict.”</em> - conflict is an inherent part of relatiosnhips. Don’t overlook it. As much as bringing people together and maintaining a feeling of prescence is needed, so is technology that might help mediate the less beautiful moments of a relationship: see: <a href="http://www.drnadig.com/conflict.htm">Relationship Conflict: Healthy or Unhealthy</a></li>
  <li>It doesn’t have to be about an existing relationship. Could your tool help to cement a new relationship in new ways? Or could it help with it’s dissolution - <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/theslice/the-pain-of-a-skype-breakup">Pixelated Heartbreak: The Unparalleled Pain of a Digital Breakup </a></li>
  <li>There’s a real the anguish of separation. This recent article in the NYTimes gives a compelling example of just how vital technologies for remote intimacy can be.  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/08/us/love-interrupted-a-travel-ban-separates-couples.html?_r=0">Love, Interrupted: A Travel Ban Separates Couples</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="deliverables">Deliverables:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Conceptual Design: Provide a high level design overview that considers and describes: what context it operates in ; what it does and how it behaves; how someone would or could interact with it; and how these interactions unfold to lead to the desired outcome? Detail your design proposal with a series of illustrations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prototype: Deliver a functional mock up of the paired device prototyped using Particle.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Storyboard: Create a <a href="https://www.fastcodesign.com/1672917/the-8-steps-to-creating-a-great-storyboard">storyboard</a> showing the proposed interaction and <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/DebAoki/introduction-to-storyboarding-for-user-experience-design">workflow</a> with the device.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Video: Create a short (1-2 minute) video illustrating how the device would be used. This should illustrate the intended scenarios, interactions, etc.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Outcomes should be reasonably well developed and documentation should be submitted to the Gallery on or before the deadline.</p>

<h2 id="final-documentation">Final Documentation:</h2>

<p>Projects should be added to the Gallery. You should provide <strong><em>a clear and concise</em></strong> description of your project, your process, and the outcomes. It should be quick to get an overview of the project.  Ideally, your description of the outcomes should be repeatable too i.e. anyone in the class can replicate it easily from the information provided.</p>

<p>Your project documentation should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Clearly explain and provide a succinct overview of the problem and how the proposed product solves that problem</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Briefly describe the design process (iterations, refinements, challenges encountered)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Document the outcome itself (code, circuit diagrams, photos, design files, 3d models, video demonstrations, etc. as required) and provide a short narrative. A bill of materials (sensors, input devices, actuators, and other components) should be provided. This documentation should be sufficiently rich to allow anyone to repeat / recreate it.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="using-online-material"><strong>Using Online Material:</strong></h2>

<p>It is perfectly fine to use examples, code, tutorials, and things you find on the web to help you realize your project. That’s part of the open-source mentality that surrounds much of Making, Arduino and microcontrollers. However, you cannot just copy and paste these solutions. In your documentation <strong><em>you must acknowledge where you got this content from</em></strong>. Include a link to any tutorials, guides, or code that are part of your final solution.</p>
