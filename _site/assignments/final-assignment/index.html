<h2 id="where-we-are">Where we are</h2>

<p>Over the past couple of weeks, you’ve been introduced to the world of connected systems and the Internet of Things. We’ve explored in-situ sensing and using data from the Internet to create ‘<em>enchanted objects</em>’. We’ve looked at how these objects can enhance not just daily routines but <em>human-to-human</em> connections. We’ve seen how <em>ambient information</em> can make data present in physical spaces and give subtle cues to action or nudges towards behavior change. You’ve been introduced to design methods for IoT applications and <em>network centered design</em>. You’ve read about <em>disruptive innovation</em> and reconsidering known spaces to design innovative products. We’ve also looked at the <em>challenges and considerations</em> in realizing internet appliances with multiple interacting stakeholders, needs and within complex service maps. <em>phew</em> and we’re only 5 weeks in…</p>

<h2 id="exploring-iot-ecosystems">Exploring IoT Ecosystems</h2>

<p>The goal of this project is to bring many of the strands together, in a grounded real-world problem space and which fully explores the potential and nature of connectedness.</p>

<p>The focus will be on <strong><em>‘ecosystems’</em></strong> of interacting internet appliances. Previously, we’ve only considered a single device in isolation, now we’re going to consider <strong><em>how several different devices can work together to solve a shared problem.</em></strong></p>

<p>What does an ‘ecosystem’ of IoT devices mean? Let’s use the analogy of cooking. To make a meal, we don’t just use one ‘thing’; we use a series of ‘things’ together. To cook our dinner, we need our fridge to store and keep the food fresh, a knife to chop, and cutting board to prepare on, a tin opener, a sauce pan, an oven, etc. All of these things work together to help us achieve the overall goal. Each of them as a specific function within the overall task. <em>The same is true of the Internet of Things; real-world problems are complex, and often require a series of complementary devices or interacting systems that work with one another to achieve the desired outcome.</em></p>

<p>To do this, we’re going to consider a problem space where there are many moving parts: many stakeholders, many users, many data sources and many potential services (think back to Week 5’s in-class exercise; Week 5 readings.)</p>

<p>The challenge for you, in designing solutions for this space, is that it will be very familiar. This makes it harder; these spaces are loaded with expectations (see Week 4 readings.) They come with all sorts of built-in assumptions. We have well established notions of how they should and do work. This makes it hard to see new possibilities or alternative approaches.  So, the goal won’t simply be to design a series of connected products for problem space, but to find ways to innovate through disruptive solutions.</p>

<p>To help with this, we’re not going to try to realize solutions for now, but <strong>we’re moving the horizon to 5 years out</strong>. This frames the project as speculative and should make it a little easier to <em>imagine new, strange and/and unfamiliar solutions</em> (see Week 6 readings.)</p>

<p>The good news, is that we a little over two weeks for the project. This gives us time for review, discussion, refinement and iteration. Something that we haven’t had room for in previous projects!</p>

<p>What is this problem space? Glad you asked…</p>

<h2 id="problem-space-connected-cuisine">Problem Space: Connected Cuisine</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Food is one of the fundamental ingredients of life. We cannot go a day without it before experiencing discomfort and the kinds of food we eat and how we eat them are closely intertwined with our cultural practices, physical environments and personal health. Nonetheless, we have been cooking progressively less. While digital media has transformed every facet of society, the fundamental technologies we encounter in the kitchen today provide only incremental improvements to the tools we have been using for hundreds of years. 
From <a href="http://fluid.media.mit.edu/projects/cornucopia-digital-gastronomy">Cornucopia</a> site, Fluid Interfaces Lab, MIT</p>
</blockquote>

<p>New technologies have radically influenced not only what we eat but how we eat. Farming, production and distribution technologies have radically changes the species, harvest, and supply chains of the food we find in our stores and in our homes. In the past century, the introduction of home refrigeration and microwaves completely transformed preparation methods. The smartphone has become an indispensable utensil for eating and dining allowing consumers to be connected to food deliveries, restaurant reservations, grocery shopping and more at the push of a button.</p>

<p>In today’s world, kitchen gadgets (cooking, baking and preparation accessories) remain a huge market. The global kitchen appliances market size was valued at over USD 170 billion <a href="http://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/kitchen-appliances-market"><sup>*</sup></a> and U.S. consumers purchased 115 million kitchen gadgets and tools in 2014 <a href="http://4rmg.com/size-of-kgt-market/"><sup>*</sup></a>. Now, they’re being augmented with digital tools and connected to the internet. A slew of new connected smart appliances for food preparation are emerging: smart fridges, faucets, trashcans, forks, plates, utensils and more are available to today’s foodie to help them in the kitchen.</p>

<p>Kitchens aren’t just spaces where meals are prepared.  They’re also places where families, friends and loved ones are brought together.  They’re facilitators of rich social rituals around preparation consumption. <em>“Recipes are family secrets, national identities, corporate mysteries, poetry. Foods are memories of lovers, vacations, childhoods, family dinners gone wrong, family dinners gone right, first dates, last dates, and shared memories. Cooking is a chore, an act of love, a ritual, a lesson.”</em>   <a href="http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~jofish/writing/gastronomica24.pdf"><sup>*</sup></a> But these aspects of cooking and eating are almost overlooked in many of the ‘smart’ technologies we envision. As we saw in Week 4, <em>“most new domestic technologies embody notions of efficiency—designed to improve time and resource management.”</em> <a href="http://jofish.com/writing/kitchenmanifesto.pdf"><sup>*</sup></a> We need to avoid thinking of convenience over culture and equally design for the landscape of domestic activities that take place here.</p>

<p>Beyond the home, the IoT is influencing what’s produced and available. A wave of cellular tools is enabling farmers to remotely control and manage their crops. And restaurants are seizing new possibilities too. Open communities like <a href="http://farmhack.org/tools">Farm Hack</a> are sharing ways to build traditional and digital tools to augment their practices.  Vertical farms are using hydro- and aqua-ponic methods to grow produce in urban settings and reduce the distance between consumer and producer. In restaurants, products like <a href="http://sprouts.io">Sprouts</a> are being used by chefs like <a href="https://food52.com/blog/17970-this-jetsons-suited-microgarden-can-grow-all-your-produce">Barbara Lynch</a> to grow produce at their restaurant. By controlling the growth, they can control the flavor palette of the produce to fit with the dish and enhance the experience for diner. This also increases the transparency and sourcing around production - a growing concern for many diners. But restaurants, particularly fine dining have continually experimented with new technologies as a mechanism to prepare extraordinary meals. <a href="http://modernistcuisine.com/about-modernist-cuisine/the-cooking-lab/">Modernist Cuisine</a> and <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/next/physics/synthetic-food-better-cooking-through-chemistry/">Molecular Gastronomy</a> are a testaments to this.
Now, <a href="https://www.wired.com/2013/09/digitalgastronomy/">algorithms can identify</a> unexpected food combinations and <a href="http://genomicgastronomy.com/work/2015-2/spice-mix-super-computer-2-0/">exciting flavors</a>. The <a href="http://fluid.media.mit.edu/projects/cornucopia-digital-gastronomy">work of Amit Zoran and Marcelo Coelho</a> pushes this even further to imagine a new age of ‘digital gastronomy’ through their project Cornucopia: <em>‘a futuristic cooking methodology based on digital technologies’</em> where they merge <em>‘kitchen tools with science fiction and actual technologies to create this new design space for gastronomy’</em> while Grant Achatz at <a href="https://www.wired.com/2006/05/achatz/">Alinea is experimenting with strange equipment</a> like the antigriddle (an appliance to chill food to minus-30 degrees Fahrenheit in an instant) because such <em>“technology allows [them] to get to the essence of food. It allows [them] to be more true with flavor, not less true.”</em></p>

<p>Let’s explore the aesthetic, social and cultural possibilities of connected cuisine. Let’s ask questions like:</p>

<p>What is the future of food production, preparation and consumption? How can we imagine a future that isn’t purely about convenience?</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>What are the new culinary tools and utensils we might imagine for an increasingly connected world?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How can we make food experiences (the social and cultural components of eating) as supported as the preparation and cooking?  How could we extend our table to dine together over distances?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What might BlueApron and other meal services look like in 5 years with the addition of smart technologies?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will farm to table be too far for food to travel, if we can automatically grow and harvest our own crops of food at home?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will food waste be reduced by 3d printing our food on demand (or mixing up a batch of Soylent)?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How will new technologies produce experiences to augment fine dining? What will this digital gastronomy be?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What will it mean for the haute cuisine chef to prepare with precision technologies or precisely control the flavor palette of dishes?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="project-brief">Project Brief</h2>

<p>This is what you’ll explore. Drawing on your own experiences and interests, this project asks you to <strong>imagine the future of the food</strong> as a connected experience.</p>

<p>You are to imagine a scenario that <strong>could feasibly exist in 5 years time</strong>. This should include a vision for an <em>ecosystem</em> of interacting connected products. This ecosystem would enhance the food experience (or any aspect of it) through the Internet of Things.</p>

<p>In support of this vision, you are asked to develop three working prototypes that illustrate this concept and that interact with one another to develop an ecosystem and support the user and the context.</p>

<p>The manner in which you approach this is up to you, but you are strongly encouraged to consider <em>disruptive</em> rather than <em>conventional</em> solutions!</p>

<p>You will work in one of the following contexts:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>At Home: Kitchen</em> - enhance the process of preparing food at home through a connected ecosystem</li>
  <li><em>At Home: Dining</em> - enhance the process of consuming food at home through a connected ecosystem</li>
  <li><em>Beyond the Home: Production</em> - the production of food and its</li>
  <li><em>Beyond the Home: Preparation</em> - enhance the process of consuming food in a restaurant through a connected ecosystem</li>
  <li><em>Beyond the Home: Dining</em> - enhance the process of consuming food in a restaurant through a connected ecosystem</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="project-requirements">Project Requirements</h2>

<p>Students will work in large groups (approximately 10 individuals per group) and asked to prepare the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A vision:</strong> a conceptual introduction to how they envision the future ecosystem working and the kinds of connected solutions that will enhance the quality of experience for it’s end users. This should be realized as a short 2-3 minute video.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Working prototypes:</strong> prepare at three working prototypes from their vision. Each prototype will be demo’ed during the final class.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Presentation of outcomes:</strong> Present their design scenario and prototypes in a 5 minute final presentation</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><em>Demo Session:</em></strong> Provide a live-demonstration of the ecosystem working and the connected experience you have designed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Process documentation:</strong> Maintain a record and illustrate their work process, rationale and design decisions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Outcome documentation:</strong> Prepare written documentation of the solution (goal, vision, design process, prototyped solutions, viability of the solutions, next steps, reflection on success, etc.)</p>
  </li>
</ol>

      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="organization">Organization</h2>

<p>The team is expected to self organized. However, it is highly recommended to coordinate as follows:</p>

<p><strong>Vision: (1-2 persons)</strong> - coordination the project’s vision; prepare vision and concept documentation; work with sub-teams to create an ecosystem</p>

<p><strong>3 x Prototype Group (3 persons each)</strong></p>

<p>Three sub-teams should work on a single working prototype that integrates with the larger vision. It is recommended to organize as three people as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><em>Developer</em> - responsible for the technical implementation (code, circuits, functionality)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Designer</em> - responsible for the visual design, form, interaction, and experience</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Liaison</em> - responsible for documentation of process; coordinate with liasions on other prototype groups + with the vision team to develop connectivity between prototypes; communicate the development of the prototype.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Organization, roles and the distribution of effort throughout the process should be noted in outcome documentation.</p>

<h2 id="reuse">Reuse</h2>

<p>This isn’t a race to the finish. This is a collaborative exploration.</p>

<p><em>Feel free to <strong>_Share, reuse, revisit_</strong> past projects as needed.</em></p>

<p>You are welcome to use the code, ideas, outcomes from any previous project even if it is not your own; but you must acknowledge it.</p>

<h2 id="final-documentation">Final Documentation:</h2>

<p>Final documentation should be added to the relevant pool on the Gallery. It is recommended that you create one project for each prototype developed, as well as, one project which explains the overall vision and links to each of the prototype’s documentation.</p>

<p>You should provide <strong><em>a clear and concise</em></strong> description of your project, your process, and the outcomes. It should be quick to get an overview of the project.  Ideally, your description of the outcomes should be repeatable too i.e. anyone in the class can replicate it easily from the information provided.</p>

<p><strong>Using Online Material:</strong> It is perfectly fine to use examples, code, tutorials, and things you find on the web to help you realize your project. That’s part of the open-source mentality that surrounds much of Making, Arduino and microcontrollers. However, you cannot just copy and paste these solutions. In your documentation <strong><em>you must acknowledge where you got this content from</em></strong>. Include a link to any tutorials, guides, or code that are part of your final solution.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The History Tablecloth is a flexible substrate screen-printed with electroluminescent material forming a grid of lace-like elements. When objects are left on the table, cells beneath them light to form a halo that grows over a period of hours, highlighting the flow of objects in the home. The Tablecloth explores an approach to design that emphasises engaging, open-ended situations over defined utilitarian purposes. Long-term deployment of the History Tablecloth in a volunteer household revealed complex ways that people experienced and interacted with the Tablecloth.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For IKEA, the world’s biggest furniture store, the time to start designing the kitchen of 2025 is now. So IKEA asked IDEO London and a group of students from Lund and Eindhoven universities to explore the social, technological, and demographic forces that will impact how we behave around food in 2025. The students spent months researching people’s attitudes and ideas about cooking and eating, and IDEO designers guided them as they built concept kitchen products.</p>
