#### Due: Monday September 24, 6:30pm before class. No late work.

#### Submit to: [RSMA 2018: Project 01](http://ideate.xsead.cmu.edu/gallery/pools/projec-01-data-garden) and [Canvas Project 01](https://canvas.cmu.edu/courses/6049/assignments/100772)

# Introduction

Sam and Dale Griffin are interested in a permanent dynamic installation for their newly redesigned backyard at their home in Palo Alto, CA. The garden was designed by [Andrea Cochran Landscape Architecture](http://acochran.com/). The Griffins are looking for a single installation that will "amplify the natural feeling of the space." Specifically, they are looking for a work that can identify and magnify specific, possibly unseen natural phenomena taking place within their designed outdoor environment.

# Design Requirements

- Use at least one sensor to acquire information about the physical world.
- Use projection to create a digital overlay of information or content.
- Projection surfaces can be existing or newly designed/installed.

# Site Information

- Home is located in a residential neighborhood.
- Owners are tech savvy but want a peaceful outdoor environment

# Design Questions

- What types of information can be read from this environment?
- What time of day will this installation be active? (Hint: only at night)
- How obvious should the digital overlay be?
- Does color matter?

# Deliverables

Groups should develop a strong "pitch" to show to the client. This pitch does not need to be a fully-functional prototype, but a collection of physical, visual and written parts that will fully convey the concept and general look and feel of the idea. This collection of parts should include:

- A well-edited video of content projected on example surfaces (plant life, sculpture, other surface...) relevant to the surfaces at the home.
- A diagram showing how the system will work
- A simple rendering showing what the content might look like when projected on the selected surfaces
- A written explanation of the concept.
