# Introduction

Over the past 10 weeks we have learned how to work with several types of scalable media, including projection mapping and pixel mapping. We have learned to interface with sensors and microcontrollers as well as how to pull data directly from the web using APIs. Several groups have experimented with motion by interfacing with servo motors and regular DC motors. 
The primary requirement for the final project is that groups think big and make the most out of the site. Rather than imagine a particular client or proposal, groups will use the final project site as a gallery space to create a project of their choosing. Similar to previous projects, installations must consider the existing architecture and be site-specific. Works do not **need** to be interactive, but must utilize some form of input data. That could be a static dataset, an image collection, a live API, sensor data, audio or video input, etc.
