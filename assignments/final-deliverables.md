<p class="message">
tl;dr: Document your project, prepare a presentation and demo.
</p>

* Deliverable a) 2 minute concept video

* Deliverable b) Working prototypes with 10 minute live demo

* Deliverable c) 3 minute presentation to accompany your 2 minute video

#### Final Deliverables
#### Due: Thursday 3rd May, 11:59pm on Canvas.


#### Documentation

* Final documentation should be added to the relevant pool on the Gallery. **You must create 4 total projects in the gallery**: one project for each prototype developed, as well as one project which explains the overall vision and links to each of the prototype’s documentation. [LINK TO GALLERY](http://ideate.xsead.cmu.edu/gallery/pools/final-assignment-exploring-iot-ecosystems).

* You should provide **_a clear and concise_** description of your project, your process, and the outcomes. It should be quick to get an overview of the project.  Ideally, your description of the outcomes should be repeatable too i.e. anyone in the class can replicate it easily from the information provided.

**Using Online Material:** It is perfectly fine to use examples, code, tutorials, and things you find on the web to help you realize your project. That’s part of the open-source mentality that surrounds much of Making, Arduino and microcontrollers. However, you cannot just copy and paste these solutions. In your documentation **_you must acknowledge where you got this content from_**. Include a link to any tutorials, guides, or code that are part of your final solution.


#### Presentation

Each group will give a 5 minute powerpoint  presentation, which includes a 2 minute video of the ecosystem


#### Demonstration
